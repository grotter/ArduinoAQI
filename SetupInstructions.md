# ArduinoAQI WiFi Setup

1. Place sensor in range of your wifi router
2. Connect sensor to power, wait about 30 seconds until display reads "conn"
3. The sensor should create a new wifi network *ArduinoAQI Setup*, connect to this network with your phone using the password `AP_PASSWORD`
4. Once your phone connects to the *ArduinoAQI Setup* network, you should get a configuration popup
5. Select your home wifi network from the dropdown and enter your password, then tap **Save**

If you entered the wrong password or need to change networks, push the silver button on the back of the sensor and it'll clear your settings and start over.

If you don't want to bother with wifi, unplug the sensor, then plug it back in. While it's doing its twirly spinup, push the silver button on the back and it'll switch to offline mode.
